# Here is an example of a fake program that DOES use our
# own custom functions. Compare this to the example that does
# NOT use our own custom functions. Why is this one better?

# Note: This is a fake function, so it will NOT run and it will say that all of these lines are errors.


#Let's create a function to make lemonade:
def make_lemonade():
  add_water()
  add_lemonade_mix()
  add_sugar()
  stir()
  pour_into_glass()

# It is hot and you are thirsty
make_lemonade()
drink_lemondade()

# Your mom asks for some lemonade too!
make_lemonade()
hand_mom_a_glass()

# Your little brother wants some too!
make_lemonade()
hand_brother_a_glass()

# Your friend wants to sell some lemonade at a stand!
make_lemonade()
sell_lemonade_to_stranger()
profit()

# Another customer!
make_lemonade()
sell_lemonade_to_stranger()
profit()
